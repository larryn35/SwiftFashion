# SwiftFashion


## About the app

SwiftFashion is a simple iOS e-commerce app built with SwiftUI. The app uses [SFStoreKit](https://github.com/larryn35/SFStoreKit), a REST API created with Swift using Vapor, to manage the store's products and stores orders in a database. 

The goal of this app was to learn about server-side Swift development with Vapor, as well as a playground to explore experiment with concepts and tools suchÂ as:
- Building regular expressions with RegexBuilder
- UI testing in Xcode
- Implementing CI/CD using Github Actions
- Animating layout transitions with AnyLayout

## Getting started
Please check out the [SFStoreKit](https://github.com/larryn35/SFStoreKit) repo for details on setting up the server needed for the app to run.

### Running the app on a physical device
Since SFStoreKit runs the server on your local machine, SwiftFashion will only work on the simulator. To run the app on a physical device, you would need to expose the server to the internet. 

I used [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/), which creates a secure tunnel to the local server and provides a public URL that can be used to access it over the internet.

After installing Ngrok and while the server is running, run the following command in the terminal:
```
./ngrok http 8080
```

The terminal should clear and look something like this:
```
    ngrok                                                                       (Ctrl+C to quit)
    
    Session Status                online
    Account                       Larry (Plan: Free)
    Version                       3.2.2
    Region                        United States (us)
    Latency                       78ms
    Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
    Forwarding                    https://1234567890.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:8000
    
    Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                                  0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Copy the forwarding URL (```https://123456790.ngrok-free.dev``` in this example) and make the following changes in the ```Endpoint.swift``` file.

```
// Endpoint.swift

extension ShoppingEndpoint {
    var header: [String: String]? {
        switch self {
        default:
            return [
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "ngrok-skip-browser-warning": "true"
            ]
        }
    }
}

extension Endpoint {
    var scheme: String { "https" }
    var host: String { "123456790.ngrok-free.dev" }
    var port: Int? { nil }
}
```

You should be able to run the app on your physical device.

## What's next
Some features that I hope to include in the future include:
- Allow users to create an account, track previous orders, and favorite products
- Support for iPadOS and MacOS
- Add an onboarding screen
- Persist cart items
- Update UI and add animations
